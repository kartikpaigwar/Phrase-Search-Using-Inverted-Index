It is mandatory for the company offering you a franchise to furnish detailed information on a range of issues connected with the proposed business opportunity.

The franchise disclosure document will reveal the fees that you can be charged, the initial investment that is needed, the territory that is being allotted to you and information on the revenue that the franchisor will generate through sales to you.

Details of litigation that the franchisor is engaged in will also be furnished. If there are a large number of on-going matters in court, you may want to understand the reason before finalizing your franchise.

your time is precious afterall.
Will you be given an exclusive territory? Or is the franchisor within its rights to appoint additional franchisees in your area of operations? The answers to these questions will determine your success or failure to a large extent.

Study the agreement carefully to understand this issue. If the franchisor is within its legal rights to do so, it may appoint multiple franchisees in your vicinity to maximize its sales. But this could impact your business and profitability.

Take your time your time

Negotiate with at least two franchisors and compare what they have to offer. Above all, remember that you will be spending eight hours or more a day on your new business. Ask yourself if you are comfortable with the product or service that you will be selling.

Take your time to decide which company to select. Once you make the initial payment to the franchisor, you are committed for the long term. Make sure that the decision you take is well thought out and not one that is rushed by the franchisor.
